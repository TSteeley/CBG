Crystal Ball Gazing

## Why?
Looking for trends in market data and using technical analysis is a bit like using a crystal ball to try to look into the future. however logic has never stopped me from bad ideas before.
This project is on the surface using a computer to try to trade stocks biut is actually just a way for me to learn, python, data analysis, optimisation, and anything else i can think to make this harder.

## What does it do?
This is primarily a backtesting algorithm. Although I have functions to interpret data they're the least exciting part.

to fully flesh this out in the future I am planning to make strategy specific functions for now i just have the general version 'fullControl'

## Future Aspirations
I want to make this code better first but my future ambition is to implement libraries written in rust to speed up computation. This may take a second however.
